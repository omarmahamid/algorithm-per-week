# Parallel problem 

Suppose you have a system that manages a large number of requests from clients. Each request consists of a list of tasks that need to be executed. You have a fixed number of worker threads that can execute the tasks concurrently. Each task takes a different amount of time to execute.

Design a mechanism to ensure that the tasks are executed efficiently and concurrently, with minimal latency and no unnecessary blocking calls.

Your solution should be implemented in a way that maximizes concurrency and minimizes the number of blocking calls. In other words, you want to ensure that all available worker threads are being used to execute the tasks as quickly as possible, while still maintaining the order of execution and avoiding unnecessary delays.
